# QCFirst## Project InformationThe point of this project is to recreate Queens College's CUNYFirst site which is used for Students to enroll into courses and contains more information like their transcript and more. Professors are also able to use CUNYFirst to create courses for students to enroll in. CUNYFirst is not the best site to use since it is very inefficient so this an attempt to improve on a bad site design.## Contributers  - Daven Santana     - https://davensantana.github.io/  - Tajirian Islam    - https://born2code1999.github.io/## Responsive Login PageUsers will land on the login page when they visit QCFirst.
