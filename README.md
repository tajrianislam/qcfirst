# QCFirst## Project InformationThe point of this project is to recreate Queens College's CUNYFirst site which is used for Students to enroll into courses and contains more information like their transcript and more. Professors are also able to use CUNYFirst to create courses for students to enroll in. CUNYFirst is not the best site to use since it is very inefficient so this an attempt to improve on a bad site design.## Link to applicationThe application is posted on GitHub with link : https://github.com/Born2Code1999/qcfirst## Contributers  - Daven Santana - Coded parts of HTML and mostly CSS, worked on the design of the pages.    - https://davensantana.github.io/  - Tajirian Islam - Coded most of the HTML and helped coding the CSS styles also helped create the design for each page.    - https://born2code1999.github.io/## Responsive Login PageUsers will land on the login page when they visit QCFirst. Login credentials will determine instructor or student.![Login page](FigmaDesign/LoginPage.png)## Sign Up PageIf user does not have an account, this is where they will create it![Signup page](FigmaDesign/SignUpPage.png)## Student HomeThis is where students see their class schedule and can navigate to add or remove class![Student Home](FigmaDesign/StudentHome.png)## Student EnrollStudent's can enroll in courses here  - Students know which classes to enroll in by using the "Go to degree requirements" feature.

Instead of having the buttons laid out in different positions we just stacked them on top of each other for the desktop design and only kept one signup button on this page.  - For the signup page there was also a small change of making two signup buttons, one for instructor and one for students and a third button that allowed you to go back to the login page if you accidently clicked sign up. We also stacked everything in one column for the mobile page since it would just work better in one column.  - For the student home page we moved the buttons from the right on desktop to under the table and for the table on mobile we made it so the data fits in all three columns instead of one long column. For mobile it just allows the page to be viewed more easily, we didn't do a drop down since it may be annoying to click something to show more information for every single part of the list.  - For the student enroll page we kept everything the same on desktop but again for mobile we just stacked everything into one column.  - We also created a new student courses page which is the page that shows up with  all the courses the student is looking for. For this page we used a table with multiple columns with different information in each column, again we used multiple columns on mobile since we didn't want to have to expand it every time you wanted to see more information about a course. The table is responsive and gets smaller as the screen gets smaller so the columns don't appear of the page ever.  - For the instructor home page we removed the third column which was a roster button since you could just click the button in the nav bar to get to the roster so it made it redundant. We also made the table appear in two columns instead of one since again it just shows all the information at once and you don't have to expand it to see more information.  - For the instructor create page everything stayed about the same just that we made everything a single column on mobile.  - For the instructor roster page everything also stayed the same here except for mobile where we kept the information in two columns instead of one since again you don't have to expand every single column to get more information.
